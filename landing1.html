    <p><span class="image right"><img src="soham.jpg" alt="" border-radius="50%" /></span>

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Chicago. I have completed my bachelors in Computer Engineering from Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai. Throughtout my 
engineering, I have developed an insatiable love for writing clean, efficient codes for providing software solutions to a product.
I am good at solving problems in Data structures and Algorithms and also worked as a teaching assistant for the same in my junior year.
My area of interest is Full Stack development with a focus on back end. <br><br>

I got a chance to work as software development intern in my sophomore year at LTI where I designed an internal system for employers 
with the help of my mentor. This was my first stint in corporate world and I learned a lot about how things work in real life. I got 
real life exposure by writing production level codes and working on real databases of the company. I worked on technologies such as 
C#, MySQL and Angular.<br><br>

In college, I was part of events team of Computer Society of India. I was responsible for organizing various types of tech events 
happening in the campus.I always want to give something back to the community, this is why I enrolled myself as a volunteer at 
Akanksha Foundation where I helped economically backward children with their weak subjects at high school level. Through this, I created 
a positive impact on over 500 students. Working at these organizations helped me manage, organize and conduct events smoothly. 
This led to an overall development of my personality.<br><br>

I love analytical and logical problem solving and would love to work in an organization wherein I could apply my coding and problem
solving skills to develop applications that would benefit the organization and the society as a whole!<br><br>
